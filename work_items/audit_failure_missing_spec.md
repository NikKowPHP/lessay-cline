# Audit Failure: Missing Canonical Specification

**Severity:** Critical  
**Description:**  
The canonical specification file `docs/canonical_spec.md` does not exist, making it impossible to perform a proper audit of the implementation. The Auditor requires this file as the single source of truth for verification.

**Required Action:**  
1. Create a complete canonical specification document
2. Ensure it covers all system requirements and features
3. Store it at `docs/canonical_spec.md`

**Impact:**  
Without a canonical specification, we cannot verify if the implementation meets the intended design and functionality. This puts the entire project's quality at risk.
