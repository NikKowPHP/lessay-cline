# Audit Failure: Missing Core Adaptive Learning Engine Files

## Missing Files Identified
- `lib/lessons.ts`
- `lib/ai-service.ts` 
- `components/LessonView.tsx`

## Critical Impact
These files are essential for implementing the Adaptive Learning Engine as specified in `docs/canonical_spec.md`. Their absence means:
- No lesson generation logic
- No AI integration for real-time feedback
- No user interface for the core learning experience

## Required Action
1. Implement all missing files according to the canonical specification
2. Ensure proper integration with:
   - Database models (prisma/schema.prisma)
   - State management (lib/stores/app-state.ts)
   - Authentication system

## Verification Steps
1. All files exist with complete implementations
2. Adaptive Learning Engine features are fully functional:
   - AI-generated lessons
   - Real-time speech-to-text feedback
   - Progress tracking
3. Passes all relevant test cases
