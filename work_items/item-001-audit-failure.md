# Audit Failure Report

**Date:** 2024-07-26
**Auditor:** ðŸ”Ž The Auditor AI

## Summary
The Lessay project has **FAILED** the static audit. Multiple instances of placeholder code, development-time artifacts, and incomplete logic were found. The codebase is not production-ready.

---

## High-Priority Failures

### 1. Placeholder Code and Comments

-   **`// TODO` Found:**
    -   **File:** `components/OnboardingForm.tsx`
    -   **Line:** `userId: 'current-user-id', // TODO: Replace with actual user ID`
    -   **Violation:** Critical logic relies on a hardcoded placeholder.

-   **`alert()` Function Used:**
    -   **File:** `components/Auth.tsx`
    -   **Line:** `alert('Check your email for the confirmation link!');`
    -   **Violation:** `alert()` is not a production-suitable UI element for user feedback.

-   **Placeholder Value in Logic:**
    -   **File:** `app/api/lessons/[id]/submit-answer/route.ts`
    -   **Line:** `score: 1, // Placeholder score, adjust as needed`
    -   **Violation:** Core scoring logic is incomplete.

### 2. Lack of Production-Grade Logging

-   **`console.log` and `console.error` Found:**
    -   **Files:**
        -   `app/api/onboarding/diagnostic/route.ts`
        -   `app/api/users/update-profile/route.ts`
        -   `app/api/payments/create-subscription/route.ts`
        -   `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`
        -   `app/api/users/sync/route.ts`
        -   `app/api/users/profile/route.ts`
        -   `app/api/lessons/[id]/submit-answer/route.ts`
        -   `components/Notifications.tsx`
        -   `components/OnboardingForm.tsx`
        -   `components/SettingsView.tsx`
        -   `components/LessonView.tsx`
        -   `lib/auth-middleware.ts`
        -   ... and more.
    -   **Violation:** The project lacks a centralized, production-ready logging utility. All instances of `console.log` and `console.error` must be replaced with calls to a proper logger (e.g., Pino, Winston) that can be configured for different environments.

## Remediation Plan
The Developer must address every item in this report.
1.  Implement a centralized logging utility in `/lib/logger.ts` and replace all `console.*` calls.
2.  Remove all `// TODO` comments by implementing the required functionality.
3.  Replace all `alert()` calls with proper UI notifications.
4.  Implement the correct scoring logic in the `submit-answer` API route, removing the placeholder.
5.  Re-run the entire implementation marathon to ensure these fixes are integrated correctly.
