## Original Problem:
## Failing Plan Path
todos/dev_todo_phase_7.md

## Task Description
Run database migrations for performance indexes:
- **Command:** `docker-compose up migration`
- **Verification:** Check Docker logs for "Running database migrations"

## Action Attempted
1. Executed `docker-compose up migration`
2. Received error: "no such service: migration"

## Verification Error
Could not execute database migration. The required migration service is missing from docker-compose.yml. The system cannot proceed with migrations until the docker-compose file is properly configured with the migration service as outlined in the architectural fix plan.

## Failed Fix Attempt:
# Emergency Fix Plan: Diagnose Docker Compose Migration Failure

## 1. Verify Working Directory
- **Task**: Check the current working directory
  - **LLM Prompt**: "Execute `pwd` command and verify the output is `/home/kasjer/projects/lessay-cline` [x]"
  - **Verification**: The `pwd` command returns the correct working directory

## 2. Check Environment Variables
- **Task**: List environment variables available to the migration service
  - **LLM Prompt**: "Execute `docker-compose exec migration env` and verify that `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly"
  - **Verification**: The output of `docker-compose exec migration env` includes `DATABASE_URL` with a valid connection string

## 3. Execute Migration with Explicit Path
- **Task**: Run the migration command with an explicit path to the docker-compose file
  - **LLM Prompt**: "Execute `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up migration` and capture the output"
  - **Verification**: Migration runs successfully and applies database changes

## 4. Clean up and reset for autonomous handoff
- **Task**: Remove assistance signal
  - **LLM Prompt**: "Delete the file `NEEDS_ASSISTANCE.md` from the root directory."
  - **Verification**: The file `NEEDS_ASSISTANCE.md` no longer exists.

## New Error:
The migration service starts but remains inaccessible. The command `docker-compose exec migration env` fails with "service 'migration' is not running", suggesting a configuration or dependency issue despite the service definition in docker-compose.yml.
