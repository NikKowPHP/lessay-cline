# Docker Environment Failure - Verification Blocked

**Failing Phase:** documentation/2_development_plan/dev_todo_phase_1.md  
**Failed Operation:** Phase Completion Verification  

## Error Context:
All Docker commands are being interrupted with SIGINT signals:
- `docker-compose exec app repomix`
- `docker-compose ps`
- `docker-compose up -d`

## Required Action:
1. Verify Docker and Docker Compose installation
2. Ensure Docker daemon is running
3. Check container configuration in docker-compose.yml
4. Resolve SIGINT interrupts on Docker commands

## Verification Artifacts:
```xml
<!-- No repomix-output available due to Docker failure -->
```

## System State:
- OS: macOS Sonoma
- Docker version: Unknown (commands not completing)
- Project directory: /Users/mikitakavaliou/projects/lessay-cline
