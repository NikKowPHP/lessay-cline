todos/dev_todo_phase_7.md

## Task Description
Run database migrations for performance indexes:
- **Command:** `docker-compose up migration`
- **Verification:** Check Docker logs for "Running database migrations"

## Action Attempted
1. Executed `docker-compose up migration`
2. Received error: "no such service: migration"

## Verification Error
Could not execute database migration. The required migration service is missing from docker-compose.yml. The system cannot proceed with migrations until the docker-compose file is properly configured with the migration service as outlined in the architectural fix plan.
