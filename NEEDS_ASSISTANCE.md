## Cache Validation Failure

**Plan File:** FIX_PLAN.md  
**Task:** Validate cache functionality  
**Error:**  
```
UrlError: Upstash Redis client was passed an invalid URL. You should pass a URL starting with https. Received: "your_redis_url_here".
```
**Attempted Solution:**  
Added placeholder Redis configuration in `.env.test` but need valid credentials for testing.
