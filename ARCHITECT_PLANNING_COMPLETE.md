# Architect Planning Complete

All production hardening plans have been successfully generated and are ready for implementation.

## Completed Phases:
1. **Observability** - Logging and health checks
2. **Error Handling** - Robust error management
3. **Security** - Input validation and rate limiting
4. **Performance** - Database optimization and caching
5. **Testing** - Comprehensive test suite

## Next Steps:
1. Developer AI should execute tasks in sequential order from:
   - `hardening_phase_1_observability.md`
   - `hardening_phase_2_error_handling.md`
   - `hardening_phase_3_security.md`
   - `hardening_phase_4_performance.md`
   - `hardening_phase_5_testing.md`

2. Monitor implementation progress through:
   - Application logs
   - Test results
   - Performance metrics

3. Verify completion of each phase before proceeding to the next.
