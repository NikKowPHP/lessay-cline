# Emergency Fix Plan: Missing Canonical Specification

## Problem Diagnosis
The system has encountered a critical failure due to the absence of the canonical specification document (`docs/canonical_spec.md`). This file is required for:
1. Architect planning
2. Developer implementation
3. Audit verification
4. Overall project coherence

## Fix Steps

### 1. Create Canonical Specification
- Create `docs/canonical_spec.md` with the following structure:
```markdown
# Canonical Specification: Lessay-Cline Application

## Overview
[Application purpose and high-level functionality]

## Core Components
1. User Authentication
2. Lesson Management
3. SRS (Spaced Repetition System)
4. Payment Processing
5. Analytics and Reporting

## Detailed Requirements
[Expand each component with specific functional requirements]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance
- Security
- Scalability

## Data Models
[Database schema and relationships]

## API Specifications
[Endpoint definitions and payload structures]
```

### 2. Populate Specification Content
- Extract requirements from existing documentation:
  - `docs/app_description.md`
  - `docs/work_breakdown/master_plan.md`
  - `work_items/` audit reports
- Consult codebase implementation for implicit requirements

### 3. Validate Specification
- Review with all stakeholders
- Ensure complete coverage of:
  - Functional requirements
  - Business rules
  - Edge cases

### 4. Update System State
- Create `signals/SPECIFICATION_COMPLETE.md` to trigger Architect
- Remove emergency artifacts:
  - `work_items/audit_failure_missing_spec.md`
  - `NEEDS_ASSISTANCE.md` (if present)

## Implementation Notes
- This is a foundational document - invest adequate time in its creation
- Ensure all future development references this specification
- Establish change control process for specification updates
