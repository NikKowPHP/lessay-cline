# Infrastructure Configuration Fix Plan

## Blocked Tasks
1. **Design for Scalability**
   - Implement cloud load balancer configuration
   - Set up auto-scaling groups in cloud provider
   - Configure database sharding with replication

2. **Ensure High Availability**
   - Design redundant architecture across availability zones
   - Implement failover mechanisms for critical services
   - Set up uptime monitoring and alerts

## Required Actions
- **Cloud Provider Setup**: Configure AWS/GCP/Azure resources
  - Load balancers
  - Auto-scaling policies
  - Multi-AZ database deployments
- **Kubernetes Configuration**:
  - Cluster auto-scaler
  - Horizontal pod auto-scaling
  - Resource quotas and limits
- **Database Optimization**:
  - Sharding configuration
  - Read replicas
  - Backup and recovery procedures
- **Monitoring**:
  - Prometheus/Grafana setup
  - Alerting rules for resource thresholds
  - Uptime checks

## Implementation Notes
- These tasks require cloud console access and infrastructure-as-code tools (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- Some configurations may need DevOps specialist intervention
- Post-implementation, run load tests to validate scalability
