# Emergency Fix Plan: Correct Docker Command

## Problem
The `docker compose` command is not recognized, preventing database migrations.

## Solution
1.  **Correct Docker command in `todos/dev_todo_phase_7.md`:**
    - [x] Use apply_diff to replace `docker compose up migration` with `docker-compose up migration`

2.  **Clean up and reset for autonomous handoff**
    - [x] **LLM Prompt:** "Delete the file `NEEDS_ASSISTANCE.md` from the root directory."
    - [x] **Verification:** The file `NEEDS_ASSISTANCE.md` no longer exists.
