Of course. Based on the provided `repomix-output.xml` and the goal of creating a complete SDLC documentation suite for an autonomous AI agent, here is a comprehensive to-do list for the architect agent.

This plan is structured to follow the logical flow of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), ensuring foundational documents are completed first, as they inform subsequent ones.

### **To-Do List for Lessay Architect Agent: Documentation Completion**

**Objective:** Complete the entire software documentation suite to provide a clear, comprehensive, and unambiguous blueprint for an autonomous AI development agent to build, deploy, and maintain the Lessay application.

**Prioritization Note:** Tasks are organized into phases. The agent should complete tasks within a phase before moving to the next, as each phase builds upon the previous one.

---

### **Phase 0: Foundation and Alignment**

*Goal: Ensure all existing work is consistent and establish a single source of truth.*

1.  **[ ] Ingest and Analyze:** Ingest all 18 files from the `repomix-output.xml`.
2.  **[x] Validate Vision Alignment:**
    *   **File:** `documentation/app_description.md`
    *   **Action:** Treat this file as the primary source of truth for the product vision.
    *   **Task:** Cross-reference all other 17 documents against `app_description.md`. Identify and flag any contradictions in features, philosophy, or technology stack. For example, ensure the `monetization_strategy.md` tiers align with the features described.
3.  **[x] Update Master Plan:**
    *   **File:** `documentation/documentation_completion_plan.md`
    *   **Action:** Update this plan to reflect the detailed tasks outlined in this to-do list. Replace the existing Gantt chart and summary with this new, more granular phased approach.

        *   Derive and list specific, measurable `Success Criteria` from the `app_description.md` (e.g., "SRS review results in a 15% improvement in vocabulary recall over 30 days").
        *   Update the `Timeline` and `Gantt` chart with realistic dates for the development, testing, and launch phases.

2.  **[x] Complete Business Requirements Document (BRD):**
    *   **File:** `documentation/templates/brd_template.md`

        *   Expand `Section 4.2 User Workflows` to create Mermaid diagrams for:
            *   The full adaptive learning loop (`Capture -> Analyze -> Plan -> Create`).
            *   The subscription and upgrade/downgrade process.
        *   Define concrete `Non-Functional Requirements` in `Section 5` based on the app's needs (e.g., Performance: "Real-time speech-to-text transcription must have a latency of < 300ms").

3.  **[x] Complete Functional Requirements Specification (FRS):**
    *   **File:** `documentation/templates/frs_template.md`

    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Create specific `FR-XXX` requirements for every feature.
        *   **Example for Lesson Delivery:**
            *   `FR-009`: The system shall capture a raw audio blob of the user's speech during a session for post-session analysis.
            *   `FR-010`: The system shall use a real-time speech-to-text API to validate the content of the user's answer immediately.
        *   **Example for SRS:**
            *   `FR-011`: The system shall maintain a `Recall Strength Score` and `Next Review Date` for every vocabulary and grammar concept per user.
            *   `FR-012`: The lesson generation logic must prioritize items where `Next Review Date` is today or in the past.

        *   **`Section 5`:** Fully define the `Database Design` using Prisma schema syntax. Include models for `User`, `Lesson`, `Exercise`, `UserProgress`, and the `SRSEntry` (with `recallStrength`, `nextReviewDate`, etc.).
        *   **`Section 3.1`:** Create detailed sequence diagrams for:
            *   The complete adaptive learning loop.
            *   User subscription and webhook processing.
