### Infrastructure Phase 1: Database Connection Pooling for Serverless Scalability

**Objective:** Ensure the application can handle concurrent requests in a serverless environment without exhausting database connections.

#### Tasks:
1. **Enable Prisma Accelerate:**
   - Sign up for Prisma Data Platform if not already done.
   - Create a new project in the Prisma Data Platform dashboard.
   - Enable Prisma Accelerate for the project and note the generated connection string.

2. **Update Environment Configuration:**
   - Add the Prisma Accelerate connection string to your environment variables as `DATABASE_URL_ACCELERATE`.

3. **Modify Prisma Client Initialization:**
   - Update `/lib/prisma.ts` to use the Accelerate connection string:
     ```typescript
     import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client/edge'
     const prisma = new PrismaClient({
       datasourceUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL_ACCELERATE,
     })
     export default prisma
     ```

4. **Verification:**
   - Deploy the updated code to a staging environment.
   - Simulate load (e.g., using a tool like k6) to ensure no `P2024` errors occur.
   - Confirm in Prisma Data Platform dashboard that connections are being pooled correctly.

**Completion Criteria:**
- Application handles 50+ concurrent users without database connection errors.
- Prisma Accelerate dashboard shows active connection pooling.
