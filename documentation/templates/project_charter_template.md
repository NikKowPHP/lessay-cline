## 1. Project Overview
### 1.1 Vision Statement
To create an AI-powered language learning platform that listens, understands, and adapts to each learner through continuous voice analysis and Spaced Repetition (SRS), transforming every interaction into measurable progress toward fluency.

### 1.2 Objectives

- Achieve 15% improvement in vocabulary recall (measured by SRS) within 30 days
- Maintain <300ms latency for real-time voice analysis
- Process 95% of payments through Stripe integration

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- 15% improvement in vocabulary recall over 30 days (SRS metric)
- 10% reduction in pronunciation errors per month (voice analysis)
- <300ms latency for real-time speech-to-text
- 90% user retention at 30 days

## 2. Scope
