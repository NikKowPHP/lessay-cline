# RISK ASSESSMENT TEMPLATE
<!-- Document Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-06-11 -->

## 1. Risk Identification
### 1.1 Threat Sources
1. **External Threats**:
   - Hackers targeting voice data
   - Competitors scraping AI models
   - Malicious bots overloading APIs
   - Voice spoofing attacks
   - API cost exploitation

2. **Internal Threats**:
   - Accidental voice data leaks
   - Unauthorized access to AI models
   - Configuration errors in LLM prompts
   - Biased training data
   - Inadequate voice data retention

### 1.2 Vulnerabilities
1. **Technical**:
   - Unencrypted voice data storage
   - Lack of rate limiting on AI APIs
   - Single point of failure in voice processing
   - Inadequate bias testing
   - No LLM hallucination detection

2. **Process**:
   - Manual deployment procedures
   - Lack of disaster recovery testing
   - Incomplete audit trails

## 2. Risk Analysis
### 2.1 Risk Matrix
| Likelihood/Impact | Low | Medium | High |
|-------------------|-----|--------|------|
| **High**          | Voice spoofing |  Data scraping | Payment breach |
| **Medium**        | API cost overrun | Inaccurate AI feedback | Voice data leak |
| **Low**           | Minor UI bugs | LLM bias |      |

### 2.2 Risk Scoring
1. **Voice Data Breach**
   Likelihood: Medium
   Impact: Critical
   Score: 15 (Medium x Critical)
    
2. **Inaccurate AI Feedback**
   Likelihood: Medium
   Impact: High
   Score: 12
    
3. **API Cost Overrun**
   Likelihood: High
   Impact: High
   Score: 16
    
4. **LLM Bias**
   Likelihood: Medium
   Impact: High
   Score: 12
    
5. **Voice Spoofing**
   Likelihood: Low
   Impact: Critical
   Score: 9

## 3. Risk Mitigation
### 3.1 Mitigation Strategies
| Risk | Strategy | Owner | Timeline |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
| Voice Data Breach | AES-256 encryption + strict access controls | Security Team | Q3 2025 |
| Inaccurate AI Feedback | Human validation pipeline + confidence thresholds | AI Team | Q2 2025 |
| API Cost Overrun | Usage monitoring + budget alerts | Finance Team | Q2 2025 |
| LLM Bias | Diverse training data + regular audits | Ethics Board | Ongoing |
| Voice Spoofing | Liveness detection + voiceprint analysis | Auth Team | Q4 2025 |

### 3.2 Residual Risk
Accepted risks:
- Minor UI bugs (low impact)
- Temporary voice processing delays during peaks
- Model accuracy variance across languages
- Higher API costs during peak usage

## 4. Review Process
### 4.1 Monitoring
- Real-time payment fraud detection
- Weekly vulnerability scans
- Monthly penetration tests
- Quarterly compliance audits

### 4.2 Review Schedule
- **Monthly**: Operational risk review
- **Quarterly**: Full risk assessment
- **Annually**: Compliance certification
- **Ad-hoc**: After major incidents
