# RISK ASSESSMENT TEMPLATE
<!-- Document Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Last Updated: DATE -->

## 1. Risk Identification
### 1.1 Threat Sources
1. **External Threats**:
   - Hackers targeting payment data
   - Competitors scraping content
   - Malicious bots overloading APIs

2. **Internal Threats**:
   - Accidental data leaks
   - Unauthorized access by employees
   - Configuration errors

### 1.2 Vulnerabilities
1. **Technical**:
   - Unencrypted user data in transit
   - Lack of rate limiting on APIs
   - Single point of failure in payment processing

2. **Process**:
   - Manual deployment procedures
   - Lack of disaster recovery testing
   - Incomplete audit trails

## 2. Risk Analysis
### 2.1 Risk Matrix
| Likelihood/Impact | Low | Medium | High |
|-------------------|-----|--------|------|
| **High**          |     |  Data scraping | Payment breach |
| **Medium**        | API overload | Service outage |    |
| **Low**           | Minor UI bugs |     |      |

### 2.2 Risk Scoring
1. **Payment Data Breach**
   Likelihood: Medium
   Impact: High
   Score: 12 (Medium x High)
   
2. **Service Outage**
   Likelihood: Medium
   Impact: High
   Score: 12
   
3. **Content Scraping**
   Likelihood: High
   Impact: Medium
   Score: 9

## 3. Risk Mitigation
### 3.1 Mitigation Strategies
| Risk | Strategy | Owner | Timeline |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
| Payment Breach | Implement PCI DSS compliance | Security Team | Q3 2025 |
| Service Outage | Add auto-scaling and failover | DevOps | Q2 2025 |
| Content Scraping | Rate limiting + CAPTCHA | Backend Team | Q2 2025 |

### 3.2 Residual Risk
Accepted risks:
- Minor UI bugs (low impact)
- Temporary API throttling during peaks
- Scheduled maintenance downtime

## 4. Review Process
### 4.1 Monitoring
- Real-time payment fraud detection
- Weekly vulnerability scans
- Monthly penetration tests
- Quarterly compliance audits

### 4.2 Review Schedule
- **Monthly**: Operational risk review
- **Quarterly**: Full risk assessment
- **Annually**: Compliance certification
- **Ad-hoc**: After major incidents
