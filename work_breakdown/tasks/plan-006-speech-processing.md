# Speech Processing Implementation Plan

## Description
Implement speech processing capabilities including TTS, STT, and audio capture.

## Tasks
- [x] (LOGIC) Integrate TTS services:
  - Google Cloud Text-to-Speech
  - AWS Polly
- [x] (UI) Implement audio capture interface with:
  - Real-time waveform visualization
  - Quality monitoring indicators
- [x] (LOGIC) Develop STT processing pipeline:
  - Real-time transcription
  - Audio preprocessing
  - Error handling
- [ ] (UI) Create audio playback controls for TTS output

## Technical Requirements
- Use Web Audio API for browser-based processing
- Implement fallback mechanisms for service failures
- Design audio quality monitoring system
