# Adaptive Learning Cycle Implementation Plan

## Description
Implement the adaptive learning system that analyzes performance and adjusts future lessons.

## Tasks
- [ ] (LOGIC) Develop post-lesson analysis module for:
  - Phonetic accuracy scoring
  - Fluency metrics calculation
  - Grammatical pattern recognition
  - Vocabulary recall assessment
- [ ] (LOGIC) Implement SRS scoring algorithm with:
  - Recall Strength tracking
  - Review scheduling
  - Mastery level calculation
- [ ] (LOGIC) Create lesson generation algorithm that considers:
  - Due SRS reviews
  - Identified weaknesses
  - Struggling concepts
  - New material introduction

## Technical Requirements
- Use machine learning for pattern recognition (TensorFlow.js)
- Implement scheduling with cron-like system
- Design extensible scoring architecture
