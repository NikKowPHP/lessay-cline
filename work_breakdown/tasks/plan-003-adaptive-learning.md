# Adaptive Learning Cycle Implementation Plan

## Description
Implement the adaptive learning system that analyzes performance and adjusts future lessons.

## Tasks
- [x] (LOGIC) Framework for post-lesson analysis module created with:
  - [x] Phonetic accuracy scoring
  - [x] Fluency metrics calculation
  - [x] Grammatical pattern recognition
  - [x] Vocabulary recall assessment
- [x] (LOGIC) Implement SRS scoring algorithm with:
  - Recall Strength tracking
  - Review scheduling
  - Mastery level calculation
- [x] (LOGIC) Create lesson generation algorithm that considers:
  - Due SRS reviews
  - Identified weaknesses
  - Struggling concepts
  - New material introduction

## Technical Requirements
- Use machine learning for pattern recognition (TensorFlow.js)
- Implement scheduling with cron-like system
- Design extensible scoring architecture
