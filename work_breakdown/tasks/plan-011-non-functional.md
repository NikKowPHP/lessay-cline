# Non-Functional Requirements Implementation Plan

## Description
Implement system-wide non-functional requirements for performance, security, and scalability.

## Tasks
- [ ] (LOGIC) Optimize for real-time performance:
  - Speech processing latency <500ms
  - API response time optimizations
  - Caching strategies
- [ ] (LOGIC) Implement security measures:
  - Data encryption at rest and in transit
  - Authentication/authorization
  - Audit logging
- [ ] (LOGIC) Design for scalability:
  - Load balancing
  - Auto-scaling configurations
  - Database sharding
- [ ] (LOGIC) Ensure high availability:
  - Redundancy design
  - Failover mechanisms
  - 99.9% uptime monitoring

## Technical Requirements
- Implement Redis caching
- Use HTTPS with TLS 1.3
- Configure Kubernetes for auto-scaling
- Set up Prometheus monitoring
