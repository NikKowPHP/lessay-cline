# Non-Functional Requirements Implementation Plan

## Description
Implement system-wide non-functional requirements for performance, security, and scalability.

## Tasks
- [x] (LOGIC) Optimize for real-time performance:
  - Speech processing latency <500ms
  - API response time optimizations
  - Caching strategies
- [x] (LOGIC) Implement security measures:
  - Data encryption (password hashing via bcrypt)
  - Authentication enhancements (audit logging)
  - Audit logging system implemented


## Technical Requirements
- Implement Redis caching
- Use HTTPS with TLS 1.3
- Configure Kubernetes for auto-scaling
- Set up Prometheus monitoring
